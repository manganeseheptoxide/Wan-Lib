# **Wan-Lib**  

A website I built in **under 5 hours** for a hackathon using **Django** and **Python 3.8.10**.  

I used **[StudyBud's Discord clone](https://github.com/divanov11/StudyBud)** as a starting template and made all necessary changes to fit the hackathon theme.  

## **Hackathon Context**  

The hackathon allowed us to choose **any cinematic universe**, and we selected **Avatar: The Last Airbender**. Our concept revolves around **Wan, the first Avatar**—we wanted to make **Wan's knowledge easily accessible** to others.  

Thus, I created **a forum-like demo website** where users can:  
✅ Read **articles** about Wan's wisdom.  
✅ Participate in **forums** discussing his knowledge.
